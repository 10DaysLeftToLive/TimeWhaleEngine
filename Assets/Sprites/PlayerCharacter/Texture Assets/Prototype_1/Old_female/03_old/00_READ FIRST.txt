For this particular sprite, the order in which she is assembled is a bit different.

She lacks a neck so some of the layering is a bit scrambled. It should be:

1. Head

2. barmR

3. tarmR

4. handR

5. torso

6. barmL

7. tarmL

8. handL

9. neck (this is so the neck won't overlap with the shirt)

10. speedo

11. shoeR (this is to make up for the fact that her ankle is not visible, so the shoe must cover it)

12. blegR

13. tlegR

14. shoeL

15. blegL

16. tlegL
